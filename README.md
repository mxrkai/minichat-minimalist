To use this chat interface, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can then customize the API base URL and API keys by modifying the values of the `apiBaseUrl` and `apiKey` variables in the JavaScript code.

Example
-------

To use this chat interface with a hypothetical chat API at `https://example.com/chat`, you would set the `apiBaseUrl` variable as follows:
```
const apiBaseUrl = 'https://example.com/chat';
